/**
 * take(): In Project Reactor, the take() operator is used to limit the number of items emitted by a Flux or Mono.
 * Itâ€™s a filtering operator that allows you to take only the first N elements or elements within a time window.
 * It is also useful when you want to cancel a long-running or infinite stream after a certain number of items or time.
 * If you want to preview the first few items of a stream (e.g., for logging or testing), then also take() is useful.
