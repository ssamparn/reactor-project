    * Flux.create(): The create() method in Flux is used when we want to calculate multiple (0 to infinity) values that are not influenced by the applicationâ€™s state.
    * This is because the underlying method of the Flux.create() method keeps calculating the elements.
    * Besides, the downstream system (e.g. take() operator) determines how many elements it needs. Therefore, if the downstream system is unable to keep up, already emitted elements are either buffered or removed.
    *
    * By default, the emitted elements are buffered until the downstream system request more elements
